## Volunteer map
This is the project for HackCamp in 2024. 

This website scrapped volunteer jobs in metro Vancouver from three other websites.
It shows grouped lists of cities, and city list can be expanded by clicking interested city to show volunteer jobs in that city.
Users can go to the original webpage by clicking the link of the job to see more information. 

This project is made by flutter for frontend and python for backend. 

Here's a link for this project's demo:
